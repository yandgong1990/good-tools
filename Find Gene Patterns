#####SOTA analysis#####

The identification of gene patterns among COVID-19 patients with different severities was performed by way of SOTA function from the clValid package. 
The number of gene modules was adjusted in terms of their variation tendencies. Then, genesbelonging to each pattern were used to carry out the gene ontology
enrichment analysis by Metascape.
